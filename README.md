This is a simple Node.js / Express / Mongoose application that is vulnerable* to a [Mass Assignment Vulnerability](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Mass_Assignment_Cheat_Sheet.html). 

The code accompanies the article [__Avoiding mass assignment vulnerabilities in Node.js__](https://snyk.io/blog/avoiding-mass-assignment-node-js/) and can be used to demonstrate a simple attack.

The scope of this repository is to try out some attacks on the vulnerable code and mitigate these vulnerabilities by updating the code according to the article.

*Vulnerable code can be found in the following files:

- [modes/newUers.js](https://github.com/snyk-snippets/avoiding-mass-assignment-vulnerability-in-nodejs/blob/main/models/newUser.js)
- [routes/routes.js](https://github.com/snyk-snippets/avoiding-mass-assignment-vulnerability-in-nodejs/blob/main/routes/routes.js)
